`Cartolina` has been created as an experimental and narrowly focused fork of 
`vts-geospatial`, a former end-to-end 3D map streaming and rendering stack 
developed by Melown Technologies / Leica Geosystems in 2015â€“2022 and officially 
discontinued in 2023.

Realizing the old system offered some unique possibilities for web-based cartographic 
terrain representaiton, I salvaged the code from the original GitHub repositories, 
refactored the relevant parts and enhanced it with new functionality, all other
the original open-source license.
