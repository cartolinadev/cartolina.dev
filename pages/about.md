## About `cartolina`

`Cartolina` was created as an experimental and narrowly focused fork of 
`vts-geospatial`, a now dysfunctional end-to-end 3D map streaming and rendering 
stack developed by Melown Technologies / Leica Geosystems in 2015–2022 and 
officially discontinued in 2023.

Recognizing the potential of the original system for web-based cartographic 
terrain representaiton, I retrieved the code from the original GitHub repositories, 
refactored key parts and added new functionality, maintaining the original 
open-source license.
