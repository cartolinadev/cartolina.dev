Any project—and particularly an open source project—lives off people's interest.
If you find `cartolina` useful I would very much like to hear from you. 

You can use any of the social network handles below for general discussion.

To submit bugs or feature requests please use the `cartolina-js` and `cartolina-tileserver` issue trackers on GitHub. 

If you'd like to contribute to `cartolina` development, you are more than welcome to do so! 
Please check out the Contributing.md files in the corresponding GitHub repository. 
I have not updated these for the new repostiory paths, but you get the idea.
